// Package mcptool is the tool dispatcher: the part of tools/list and

// its answer travels in, the metric, and the place to hang an audit.
//
// Visibility is the tool's own answer, not the registry's: Describe reports
// whether this caller may see it at all — or Visible does, for a tool that
// would rather not build a description to say no — so the registry never learns
