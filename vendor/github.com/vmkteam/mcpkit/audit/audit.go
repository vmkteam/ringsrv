// Package audit writes one record per MCP call: who asked, what they asked
// for, what was decided and what came out.
//
// Two rules shape everything here. A record is written for every call including
// the refused ones — a trail of successes answers none of the questions a trail
// is kept for. And answers never go into it: a log carrying bodies is an
// unmanaged second copy of the data that passed through it.
//
// Model-authored strings are masked on the way in, always, whatever the answer
// path is configured to do: a deployment may choose to show a user full values,
// but the log is read by everyone who can read logs.
